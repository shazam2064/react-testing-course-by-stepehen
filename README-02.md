### Lecture 5. Project Setup

For now we are going make simple project with Create React App and test it, and later 
we will use a large project with complex features, we will test it and add in new features.

- For our first project we will have simple mockup form at the top.
- The form will have a name and email input, and a submit button.
- Once submitted it will display the name and email below the form on a table.

1. To setup our project go to the terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app 2users
   ```
   - This will create a new React project in a folder called `2users`.

### Lecture 6. Quick Note
The next three videos will show building a simple React app from scratch. 
No testing is covered in these videos, I only show how to build the app.

Don't want to spend time building a simple app? No problem! 
Skip ahead three to the videos to the lecture called 'Completed Users Project' 
and download the completed version of the project there.
